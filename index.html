            </div>
            <p>Start by listing the most recent degree you’ve earned and work backward. Be sure to include any diplomas that are relevant to the position you’re applying for, such as a BA in Engineering or Web Development. And if you don’t think that you have the educational background to land a job as a full-stack developer, then consider enrolling in a software engineering bootcamp.  
                Make sure your resume includes your full-stack developer skills, both soft skills and hard skills. The hard skills are typically technical competencies that the employer has requested, and the soft skills are non-technical but still very important to the success of the job.

            <h3>Frontend Developer!</h3>
            <p>Front-end developers create user interfaces (UI). UI is the graphical layout of an application that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look. "I've always found crafting polished user interactions that surprise and delight users to be the most rewarding and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, a software engineer at Meta. "In order to do this, you need to both have an eye for detail and a rock-solid understanding of the platform."
